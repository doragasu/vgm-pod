Portable VGM player for Genesis/Megadrive and Master System files. Right now almost nothing is done. I have wired a YM2612 and a SN76489 to a Stellaris Launchpad, and I'll start writing the software to parse VGM files and play them using these two chips. When everything works, I'm planning to design a PCB including all the hardware, including a LiPo battery and charger, so you can take the player with you wherever you want.

I'm extremely busy at the moment, so expect a very slow development!
