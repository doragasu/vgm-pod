/************************************************************************//**
 * \file syscalls.c
 * \brief System calls implementation.
 *
 * Most system calls are implemented as stubs, but some basic functionality
 * has been coded. Most notably _sbrk (for heap allocation), _write (to be
 * able to write to the UART0 using printf, etc.), and _read (to be able to
 * read from the UART0 using scanf, etc.).
 *
 * \note Current implementation includes a non-blocking _write and a blocking
 * _read function.
